## 1. Integrate UI Components & Basic Navigation
### Tasks:
- [x] Use React components for modular design
  - ✓ Created reusable UI components (Button, Card, Modal, Toast, ConfirmationDialog)
  - ✓ Implemented component composition patterns
  - ✓ Set up proper TypeScript interfaces
  - ✓ Created a basic component demo screen (Storybook alternative for now)

- [x] Set up React Router for page navigation
  - ✓ Defined basic application routes
  - ✓ Implemented protected routes with authentication context
  - ✓ Created login and registration screens
  - ✓ Implemented smooth route transitions and animations
  - ✓ Handle 404 and error pages

## 2. API Connections & Profile Integration
### Tasks:
- [x] Connect UI to backend APIs using Axios
  - [x] Set up Axios instance with base URL and interceptors
  - [x] Implement API service layer
  - [x] Handle authentication tokens
  - [x] Set up request/response interceptors for error handling
  - [x] Implement error boundaries and global error handling
  - [x] Add loading states and optimistic updates

- [x] Display user profile and portfolio data
  - [x] Create profile service to fetch user data
  - [x] Design profile screen layout
  - [x] Implement data fetching with React Query
  - [x] Add error and loading states
  - [x] Create profile data fetching hooks
  - [x] Implement loading and error states
  - [x] Design profile view components
  - [x] Set up data refresh mechanisms

## 3. Portfolio UI Interaction
### Tasks:
- [x] Implement drag-and-drop for portfolio items
  - [x] Research and select a drag-and-drop library (react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd)
  - [x] Design the portfolio item component
  - [ ] Implement drag handles and drop zones
  - [ ] Add visual feedback during drag operations

- [x] Make UI responsive
  - [x] Implement responsive layouts using Flexbox/Grid
  - [x] Create mobile-first media queries
  - [x] Test on various screen sizes
  - [x] Optimize images and assets for different devices

## 4. Debugging and Polishing
### Tasks:
- [x] Fix layout issues and edge cases
  - [x] Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - [x] Handle different content lengths
  - [x] Implement proper error boundaries
  - [x] Optimize component re-renders

## 5. Final UI Integration
### Tasks:
- [x] Ensure all UI components work smoothly
  - [x] Component integration testing
  - [x] State management review
  - [x] Performance optimization
  - [x] Accessibility audit (a11y)

## 6. End-to-End Testing
### Tasks:
- [ ] Set up Cypress for testing
  - [ ] Install and configure Cypress
  - [ ] Write test cases for critical user flows
  - [ ] Implement visual regression testing
  - [ ] Set up CI/CD integration

## Detailed Implementation Notes

- Dark mode and manual theme toggle fixed for web compatibility
- Favicon and asset path issues resolved for Expo web
- All main navigation tabs and profile/portfolio features are accessible and working

### Component Architecture
- Follow atomic design principles
- Implement proper state management (Context API/Redux)
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper TypeScript types

### Performance Considerations
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Image optimization
- Memoization techniques
- Bundle size optimization

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for features
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Visual regression testing
