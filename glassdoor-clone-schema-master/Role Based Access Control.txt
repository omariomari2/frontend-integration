“Own” means the user can access/modify only their own data, not others'.


Notes:

    All sensitive endpoints require authentication via JWT.

    Role checks are enforced using Spring Security annotations like @PreAuthorize.

    Admins can override restrictions and manage all users and data.

    Users cannot view or modify other users’ private data.

    Guests are limited to public, read-only endpoints and authentication.
